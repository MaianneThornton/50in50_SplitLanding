## My process💭

This is a simple project that I started by marking out initial classes and in the html file to be later used for styling. Next I began styling the css by creating custom variables, styling each side, and the buttons. I then added functionality by way of JavaScript to switch between classes when the user hovers over each side.

### Built with👷🏾‍♀️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned👩🏾‍🏫

I learned the logic behind making a split landing page functional. I will be applying this to future projects where needed.

I also learned that when using the before or after selectors you MUST add content for the style to be visible.

### Continued development🔮

In the future I plan on continuing to practice positioning elements using flexbox, and using different selectors such as nth of type to select elements.

I also plan on continuing to practice using event listeners to make my pages more functional.

I plan on continuing to practice using different query selectors to make selecting elements more precise.

### I'm really proud of these code snippets✂️

```css
.split.right,
.split.left,
split.right::before,
.split.left::before {
  transition: all var(--speed) ease-in-out;
}
```
